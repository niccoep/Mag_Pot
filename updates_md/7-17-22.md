# Notch Calibration

The notch calibration works by applying piecewise [linear transforms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE) to the input space of the stick box. It might sound a little complicated if you don't know how linear transforms work but they are very simple in principle and pratice. 

The piecewise part means that we will apply 8 different linear transforms to the eight octants on the input space
